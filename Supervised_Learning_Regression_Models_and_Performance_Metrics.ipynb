        "\n",
        "To ensure that the regression results are **valid and reliable**, certain assumptions must be satisfied. These are the **five key assumptions** of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Linearity**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The relationship between the **independent variable (X)** and the **dependent variable (Y)** must be **linear**.\n",
        "* This means changes in X result in proportional changes in Y.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Example:**\n",
        "If study hours increase linearly, marks should also increase linearly — not exponentially or in a curved pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Independence of Errors**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The residuals (errors) should be **independent** of each other.\n",
        "* No correlation should exist between error terms.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Example:**\n",
        "The error for one observation should not depend on the error for another observation (common in time series data).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Homoscedasticity**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The **variance of errors** should be **constant** across all levels of X.\n",
        "* In other words, the spread of residuals should remain the same for all predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Violation:** When errors increase or decrease as X changes (heteroscedasticity).\n",
        "\n",
        " **Example:**\n",
        "If marks vary evenly for all levels of study hours, the assumption holds.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Normality of Errors**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The residuals (difference between observed and predicted Y) should follow a **normal distribution**.\n",
        "* This is important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Example:**\n",
        "A histogram or Q–Q plot of residuals should look approximately normal (bell-shaped).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. No (or minimal) Multicollinearity**\n",
        "\n",
        "* In **simple** linear regression, there is only **one independent variable**, so multicollinearity doesn’t apply.\n",
        "* But in **multiple** regression, it means independent variables shouldn’t be highly correlated.\n",
