POST requests are not cached or stored in browser history by default.\n",

The simplest method is using the abort() function from flask to immediately stop execution and return an error response, such as abort(404) for “Not Found.” You can also use custom error handlers with the @app.errorhandler() decorator to define what should be returned for specific errors.
