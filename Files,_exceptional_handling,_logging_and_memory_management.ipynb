        "\n",
        "Compiled languages translate the entire source code into machine code before the program is run. This means that the code goes through a compilation process that converts it into a standalone executable file. Because the program is already translated into native machine code, it generally runs faster and more efficiently. Errors in compiled languages are usually caught during the compilation stage, so the program won’t run until those errors are fixed. Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Rust. However, compiled programs need to be recompiled for different platforms, which makes them less portable.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime through an interpreter. Instead of producing a separate executable, the interpreter reads and executes each instruction directly. This allows for more flexibility and easier debugging since you can test and run code interactively. However, interpreted programs often run slower than compiled ones because each line must be translated as the program runs. Errors in interpreted languages are detected only when the interpreter encounters the problematic line. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. Interpreted languages are more portable because the same source code can run on any system that has the appropriate interpreter installed."

        "* High Memory Usage:\n",
        "Python objects generally take more memory than in low-level languages like C, which can be a challenge in memory-constrained environments.\n",

        "* Lack of Manual Control:\n",

        "* Resource Sharing:\n",
        "Threads share the same memory space, making data sharing between them easier compared to multiprocessing.\n",

        "* Faster Execution for I/O-bound Tasks:\n",
